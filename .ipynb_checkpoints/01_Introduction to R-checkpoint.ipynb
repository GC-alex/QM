    "## What is R?\n",
    "\n",
    "R is a programming language that is used for data analytics. It is primarily used in academics and research. Statistical models can be written with only a few lines of code and it has a steep learning curve - especially if you know the basics and are not afraid of experimenting with those.\n",
    "It has an active community and a big code repository with implementable packages to make your coding life more easy and more divers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will work with R in two ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Jupyter Notebook.** This is were you are currently at. This interactive Browser Page allows you to write your code, follow instructions and experiment a little with R as a programming language. Everything without installing, downloads or any other complicated setups.\n",
    "With Juypter Notebook we will follow through the tutorial and in the lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Local R** For the exam project and for your scientifique future, you will work with R on your local drive. It is a little less intuitive but we will guide you through it in no time! Just check out our **00_Set up your local R** file for that!\n",

    "## Let's start with the basics!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will start with some basics right here in the Jupyter-Notebook.\n",
    "If you prefer your local R (RStudio) you can simply download this Jupyter-Notebook file as an r-file (r.) or markdown-file(.md)\n",
