##  About Quantitative Methods

Quantitative Methods is one of the fundamental courses for students of the Master [Global Change Geography](https://www.geographie.hu-berlin.de/en/studies/study-programs/master-degree-programs/master-of-science) of Humboldt University Berlin. It's goal is the ability to analyse different advanced statistical and mathematical approaches to the quantitative analysis of geo- and environmental data and the modelling of human-environment systems.

## Reading Material


Alternatively, you may want to follow one of the numerous tutorials for R fundamentals.
e.g., [RStudio](https://resources.rstudio.com/), [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r), [UMC Utrecht](http://www.r-tutorial.nl/).
In case you want to look up R in context of modeling &statistics, the [the R Book by Crowley](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~robert/teaching/estadistica/TheRBook.pdf) might be also of interest.It is propably the most helpful ressource in addition to this course. 
For vizualizing your data: [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/).
